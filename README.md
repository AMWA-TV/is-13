<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does it do?

- Allows control and monitoring applications to update resource labels, descriptions and tags

### Why does it matter?

- Operators need to be able to distinguish between different resources
- Often this is aided by user-provided information (beyond what is provided by the vendor through BCP-002-02)

### How does it work?

- Media Nodes advertise it in their Node `services`
